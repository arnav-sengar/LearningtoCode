Operator Precedence
------------------------
In C++, operator precedence specifies the order in which operations 
are performed within an expression. When an expression contains multiple 
operators, those with higher precedence are evaluated before those 
with lower precedence.

Operator Associativity 
-------------------------
Operator associativity determines the order in which operands are 
grouped when multiple operators have the same precedence. There are 
two types of associativity:

Left-to-right associativity: In expressions like a + b - c, the 
addition and subtraction operators are evaluated from left to right.
So, (a + b) - c is equivalent.

Right-to-left associativity: Some operators, like the 
assignment operator =, have right-to-left associativity. 
For example, a = b = 4; assigns the value of b to a.
