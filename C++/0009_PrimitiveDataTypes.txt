Primitive Data Types
-------------------------------
Fundamental data types directly implemented by the C++ language.

Some are -
    Character types
    Integer types
        signed and unsigned
    Floating-point types
    Boolean types

Size and precision is often compiler-dependent
    #include <climits> 
    //contains information of the size and precision of the data types of your specific compiler.


Type sizes
-------------------------------
Expressed in bits

The more bits, the more values that can be represented

The more bits, the more storage required


Character Type
-------------------------------
Used to represent single characters, 'A', 'X', '@'
Wider types are used to represent wide character sets

Integer Types
-------------------------------
Used to represent whole numbers.
Signed and unsigned versions.

Type name                  |       Size/precision
---------------------------|---------------------------
signed short int           |        atleast 16 bits
signed int                 |        atleast 16 bits
signed long int            |        atleast 32 bits
signed long long int       |        atleast 64 bits
_                          |
unsigned short int         |        atleast 16 bits
unsigned int               |        atleast 16 bits
unsigned long int          |        atleast 32 bits
unsigned long long int     |        atleast 64 bits

Floating-point Type
-------------------------------
Used to represent non-integer numbers
Represented by mantissa and exponent(scientific notation)
Precision is the number of digits in the mantissa
Precision and size are compiler dependent

Boolean Type
-------------------------------
Used to represent true and false
Zero is false
Non-zero is true
Usually 8 bits
