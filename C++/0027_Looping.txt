Looping 
---------------------
iteration
    The third basic building block of programming 
        sequence, selection, iteration
    
    Iteration or repetition

    Allows the execution of a statement or block of statements repeatedly

    Loops are made up of a loop condition and the body which contains the  statements to repeat.

Some typical use-cases
    Execute a loop:
        a specific number of times
        for each element in a collection
        while a specific condition remains true
        until a specific condition becomes false
        until we reach the end of some input stream
        forever 
        many, many more

C++ looping constructs:
    
    for loop:
        iterate a specific number of times
    
    Range-based for loop:
        one iteration for each element in a range of collection

    while loop:
        iterate while a condition remains true

        iterate while the condition becomes false

        check the condition at the beginning of every iteration

    do-while loop:
        iterate while a condition remains true

        stop when the condition becomes false
        
        check the condition at the end of every Iteration
