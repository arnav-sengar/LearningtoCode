Expressions
------------------------
The most basic building blocks of a program

"a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation

Computes a value from a number of operands

There is much, much more to expressions - not necessary at this level.

Eg:
    34                        //literal
    favourite_number          //variable
    1.5 + 2.8                 //addition
    2 * 5                     //mutliplication
    a > b                     //relational
    a = b                     //assignment


Statements
-------------------------
A complete line of code that performs some action

Usually terminated with a semi-colon

Usually contain expressions

C++ has many type of Statements
    expression, null, compound, selection, iteration,
    declaration, jump, try blocks, and others

Eg:
    int x;                     //declaration
    favourite_number = 12;     //assignment
    1.5 + 2.8;                 //expression
    x = 2 * 5;                 //assignment
    if(a > b)                  //if
    {
        cout << "a is greater than b" << endl;
    }
