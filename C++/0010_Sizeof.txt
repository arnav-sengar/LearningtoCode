The size of operator 
    determines the size in bytes of a type or variable.

Eg:
    sizeof(int)
    sizeof(double)

    sizeof(some_varaible)

    sizeof some_varaible 
    //paranthesis are optional for variables.

<climits> and <cfloat>
    The <climits> and <cfloat> include the files contain size and precision information about your implementation of C++.
