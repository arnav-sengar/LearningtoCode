Variables
------------------------------
A Variable is an abstraction for a memory location

Allow programmers to use meaningful names and not memory addresses

Variables have--
   Type - their category(integer, real number, string, person, account...)
   Value - the contents(10, 3.14, "Arnav"...)

Variables must be declared before they are used.

A variable value may change

age = 21;     // Compiler Error

int age;      // No Error
age =21;   

Declaring a Variable
-------------------------------
Syntax:
    variable_type variable_name;

Eg: int age;
    double rate;
    string name;
    Account arnav_account;
    Person arnav;

Rules
-------------------------------
*Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

*Must begin with a letter or underscore(_)

*Cannot use C++ reserved keywords

*Cannot redeclare a name in the same scope.

*remember....C++ is case sensitive

    Legal        |    Illegal
  ---------------|---------------
    Age          |     int
    age          |     $age 
    _age         |     2015_age
    My_age       |     Age+1

*Be consistent with your naming conventions
   myVariableName or my_variable_name
   avoid beginning names with underscores

*Use meaningful names
    not to long and not to short

*Never use variables before initializing them. 

*Declare variables close to when you need them in your code.


Initializing Variables
--------------------------------------
int age;  // uninitialized

int age =21;  // C-like initialization

int age (21);  // Constructor initialization

int age {21};  // C++11 list initialization Syntax
               // recommended


Globle and Local variables
--------------------------------------
Global variable--

The variable that are declared outside of any function are called global variables.

They can be accessed from any part of your program.(this means they can potentially changed from any part of the program)

They are automatically initialized to zero(0)
