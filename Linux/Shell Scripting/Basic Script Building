In linux we have to use multiple commands for our use and sometimes it becomes tiring to be using the same command over and over again.

Here comes the shell scripting, where we make a script file containing all the commands that are to be executed and all the commands can be executed at once.This helps to decrease our worktime from hours to mere minutes!!

How to create a script file:
----------------------------
we can use vim to create a script file-
      vim <file_name.sh>

Once we are inside the editor-
      start the file with - #!/bin/bash/
    this is to denote that in which shell the script is to be executed(eg. bash)

NOTE: # pound sign -- comment line
      #! (under which shell to run the script e.g.bash)
      #!/bin/bash/ (special case)


How to display messages in a script:
------------------------------------  
Like we display a message normally in the terminal using the 'echo' command, the same we can do in the script file

Before a command just type-
    echo "Your_message"
    *this will display the message just above your command for which you are displaying the message
     
    echo -n "Your_message"
    *this will display the message in the same line as of your command to be executed and you can align it so it looks more readable

Using Variables:
----------------
-- environment variables
-- user variables
-- command substitution

1.Environment variable :
Environment variables are name-value pairs that all processes can access within a particular user environment or shell session.
